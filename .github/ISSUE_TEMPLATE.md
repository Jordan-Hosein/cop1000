Congratulations! I'm glad you're choosing to open an issue in order to ask for help or start a conversation with your classmates. Please remove these instructions and replace with your own content. I just wanted to take this opportunity to offer you some guidelines.

1. Be explicit -- if you're asking the professor for help, mention `@cop1000/professor`.
1. If instead you'd like to ask a particular classmate, or groups of classmates, mention them with the `@` and their handle (for example, `@hectorsector`)
1. You can reach all classmates by mentioning `@cop1000/all-students`. Use this sparingly. If you constantly mention everyone, people will stop paying attention to you :wink:
1. You can drag-and-drop images into this field and the image will be uploaded. Include screenshots, if needed!
1. You can hyperlink stuff in this field -- link to possible solutions or code so that no one has to do duplicate work.
1. Issues are public, DO NOT use an issue to communicate confidential information. Send a private email for that.
