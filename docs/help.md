# How to Ask for Help

There are a number of ways you can ask for help. Here are just a few, in order of preference!

1. Use the read-search-ask strategy when you get stuck:
  - First, read the error message, if one exists.
  - If that didn't help, search Google.
  - Finally, ask another human, like your classmates, professor, or a community resource.
1. An [issue](https://github.com/cop1000/cop1000/issues/new) is the easiest way to reach the professor or classmates. When you start a new issue, it will auto-populate with some helpful tips and instructions. Read these!
1. If you are communicating confidential information (like questions about your grade, your VID number, phone number, etc), do not use issues. Instead, you can send an e-mail. You can email the professor or your classmates using the link that appears on Blackboard.
1. Online communities like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) are fantastic ways to get some help. However, if their help yields to a solution, you should attribute credit to them.
